	Explanation of "android-template"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Android requires some special files to compile properly. There is a minimum set of file of which
almost all provided here, but some need to be generated.

    Necessary files:

1.	AndroidManifest.xml
	This file is required to build your Android app. You have to define a unique package name
	and set up a of the few variables (such as app name) in order to make everything work.

2.	build.xml
	Simply copy-paste this file. There are no changes needed to be done here.

3.	project.properties
	April technically supports API level 4 of Android, but has only been used and tested with
	API level 7. This file defines the minimum Android compilation target. You shouldn't
	change it, but this is what you have to change if you want to compile your app for
	earlier targets.

4.	local.properties
	This file is usually generated by Ant. While you should generate your own file, in
	reality this file only contains the local path to the SDK so you can actually just take
	it as it is and change the path manually to suit your machine.

5.	src/AprilActivity.java
	The best way to use this file is a pre-build event that copies it into the src/
	directory where you build your Android application (e.g. using xcopy). That way SVN
	updates of the file will automatically update the file you use to build.

6.	src/Example.java
	This is just an example file for using April on Android. Make a copy for yourself, change
	the name of the file (it has to match the class name inside of the file!) and change all
	the necessary definitions inside of the file (which should be package name, class name
	and the name of the library that's being loaded). Don't change
	"net.sourceforge.april.AprilActivity".

    Additional files:

1. 	res/values/AprilSplashScreen.xml
	Only required if you intend on using a splash screen at the very application startup

2.	res/drawable/april_splash_screen.png
	This is an example file for a splash screen. Edit "AprilSplashScreen.xml" if you change
	the filename.

Notes:

If you want to use a splash screen, make sure to change "<application android:theme" in your
Android.xml and set it to"@style/AndroidSplashScreen" (which matches the style in
"AprilSplashScreen.xml") so the appropriate style is used.
